# MacAddressTableRecorder

### Purpose
- This application provides cached MAC address table content
- The MacAddressTableRecorder is continuously going through the devices of the MicroWaveDeviceInventory and addresses the RPC for uploading the content of the MAC address table
- Received content is stored in an internal database
- The MacAddressTableRecorder shall continuously operate in the background like a sanitation function
- It is a precondition for other applications assessing MAC address information
